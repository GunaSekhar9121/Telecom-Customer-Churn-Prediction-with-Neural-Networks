# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-with-Neural-Networks
Forecast customer churn in telecom using neural networks. Churn, when customers leave, is vital for telecoms. Identifying potential churners helps keep customers, reducing revenue loss and improving satisfaction.

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates a comprehensive churn prediction analysis pipeline. The script utilizes machine learning libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn to preprocess the data, build a neural network model, and evaluate its performance.

**Key Features:**

Data loading and preprocessing: The script loads telecom customer data from a CSV file and performs data cleaning, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical format.
Data visualization: Visualizes the distribution of customers based on various features like tenure, monthly charges, and total charges, segmented by churn status.
Feature engineering: Scales numerical features using MinMaxScaler and prepares data for modeling by splitting into predictor variables and target variable.
Model building: Constructs a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API, with a configurable architecture.
Model evaluation: Evaluates the trained model on test data using accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Result analysis: Provides insights into model performance metrics and implications for telecom companies.
This project serves as a practical example of using machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, for churn prediction in the telecom industry. It can be used as a reference for data scientists, analysts, and professionals interested in customer churn analysis and predictive modeling. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome to enhance the functionality and effectiveness of the churn prediction model.
